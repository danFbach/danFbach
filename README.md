a builder, trying to contribute more to OS projects that i use.

dotnet & c#. built and maintain homebrew erp.
```cs
while(stillBuilding)
  await vcBuyOutAsync();
```
web devel.
```html
<aside id="this-is-not-actually-programming"></aside>
<script>
  fetch('/SomeVeryImportantData')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(res => {
      console.log(res);
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.warn('what data');
    });
</script>
```
php is tolerable.
```php
<?
  echo 'why people choose to use me, i will never know.';
?>
```
i know some legacy languages too. 

left repo's up from my guppy stage, laugh at them with me.
